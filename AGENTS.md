## What this repo is

**Status: `core/` and `ns3/` in progress (Phase 5, #6).** The core's first slice, the data path of ch. 4 (eq. 4.1 deposit on every packet, promiscuous reception, the forwarded-ID duplicate list, eq. 4.3 forwarding, the dead-end bounce, periodic decay, the versioned header), builds and tests on its own and inside ns-3 as the contrib module `termite`, whose adapter carries it out on swarm-core's `SwarmRoutingBase` with the header on every data packet. It started once the fidelity sheet (#4) and the anchor-miss pre-registration ([#5](https://github.com/swarm-routing/Termite/issues/5#issuecomment-6757193490), accepted 2026-11-10) were in: golden rule 12 is met. Route requests and replies, hello, seed and next-hop failure come next; until a node can learn a destination it has not heard from (hello, seed or a route request), a fresh network delivers nothing, so the module has no example and no determinism program yet. Update this file in the PR that adds each part.

Termite (Roth & Wicker; GLOBECOM 2003, SIDM 2005, Roth's 2005 Cornell dissertation) as a standalone hexagonal protocol: routing by stigmergy, where routing state rides inside **data** packets, there are no control ants, and forwarding is randomised multipath over a pheromone table. A simulator-agnostic `core/` and an ns-3 `ns3/` adapter (contrib module `termite`) linking against `swarm-core`. It replaces AntHocNet's `termite` comparator arm, whose v2.5.0 anchor **missed** (swarm-routing/AntHocNet#587).

```
core/       simulator-agnostic algorithm + unit tests (no ns-3 headers; MIT OR GPL-2.0-only, core/LICENSE),
            on swarm-core's dual-licensed core/ primitives (pinned: SWARM_CORE_REF in core/CMakeLists.txt)
  termite-config.h    the ch. 4 constants, each citing its docs/fidelity.md row
  termite-packet.*    the packet header (six fields of §4.2.6 + type) and its versioned wire format
  termite-router.*    per-node pheromone table and data decisions (ports in, RouteDecisions out); reports through swarm-core's IRouterObserver (docs/observer.md)
  test/               the core tests (plain CMake + ctest; the ns-3 suite runs the same list)
ns3/        contrib module `termite` (GPL-2.0-only), compiling core/ on swarm-core
  model/termite-header.*            the core's header as an ns3::Header, right after the UDP header of every data packet (in front of any other transport header; #95)
  model/termite-routing-protocol.*  the adapter: SwarmRoutingBase carrying out the core's decisions, promiscuous reception
  helper/termite-helper.*           TermiteHelper (swarm-core's SwarmRoutingHelper)
  helper/termite-bench-arms.cc      the `termite` arm of ns3-tools' routing-compare (built only beside routing-bench)
  test/termite-test-suite.cc        `test.py -s termite`: the core tests, header roundtrip and fuzz, the adapter on static topologies, determinism
docs/       fidelity sheet (dissertation section -> implementation), parameters with sources, the anchor-miss analysis; observer.md (what the core reports, how data headers are counted)
.github/workflows/core.yml   core/ alone: strict warnings, tests, ASan + UBSan, clang-format (check `core`)
.github/workflows/ns3.yml    ns3/ in ns3-dev on swarm-core main, with routing-bench
.github/workflows/benchmark-cell.yml   one benchmark cell at a pinned source_sha (reusable-benchmark-cell.yml, build mode); dispatched by ns3-campaign
tools/bench/campaigns/   campaign plans: smoke.yaml (the change-test smoke against the base)
```

## Build & verify

`core/` builds and tests alone, with no ns-3 tree (CI: `.github/workflows/core.yml`):

```bash
make core-test    # cmake -S core -B build/core && cmake --build build/core && ctest --test-dir build/core
cmake -S core -B build/asan -DTERMITE_CORE_SANITIZE=ON -DSWARM_CORE_DIR=/path/to/ns3-swarm-core/core   # a local swarm-core
```

It fetches swarm-core at `SWARM_CORE_REF` unless `SWARM_CORE_DIR` names a
checkout's `core/`; bump the pin together with `core-deps` in
`.github/workflows/licence.yml` and `.github/workflows/ns3.yml`, the
`swarm-core=` line under `dependencies:` in
`.github/workflows/benchmark-cell.yml`, and `SWARM_CORE_REF` in the
`Makefile`. The ns-3 module builds on swarm-core
`main` instead; the `swarm-core / pin` check (`swarm-core-pin.yml`) fails when main's `core/` is no
longer the pinned one, or when the five places name different SHAs, so a
swarm-core change is met by a pin bump here.

CI for `ns3/` is [`reusable-ns3-ci.yml`](https://github.com/swarm-routing/.github/blob/main/.github/workflows/reusable-ns3-ci.yml) (`.github/workflows/ns3.yml`): the module builds inside `ghcr.io/swarm-routing/ns3-dev:latest-{debug,sanitized}` with strict warnings, coverage and SonarQube Cloud, and runs `test.py -s termite`. Locally:

```bash
make help    # the org's standard target names: build, test, lint, format, check, clean, shell, ci
make check   # everything CI gates on
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src/termite:ro" -v "$PWD/../ns3-swarm-core:/src/ns3-swarm-core:ro" \
    ghcr.io/swarm-routing/ns3-dev:latest-debug \
    ns3-build-contrib --strict-warnings --quality-modules termite --test \
    swarm-core=/src/ns3-swarm-core termite=/src/termite/ns3
```

(`make test` does the same with `SWARM_CORE_NS3=<checkout>`, default
`../ns3-swarm-core`). To build the harness arm and run it in the same
container, also mount `swarm-routing/ns3-tools` at `/src/ns3-tools`, add
`routing-bench=/src/ns3-tools/ns3/routing-bench` before `termite=`, and pass
`--run "routing-compare --scenario=paper --nNodes=20 --time=30 --runs=1
--protocols=termite"` to `ns3-build-contrib`. CI passes `dependencies:
swarm-core=swarm-routing/ns3-swarm-core@main` and
`routing-bench=swarm-routing/ns3-tools@main:ns3/routing-bench` and runs that
`routing-compare` line as the smoke. Until the core can learn a destination
it has not heard from (#6), the arm delivers nothing there (PDR 0, every drop
a route drop); the smoke checks that it registers and runs clean. The
determinism gate (`determinism:` in ns3.yml) waits for an example that
delivers; `test.py`'s determinism case covers the adapter meanwhile.

Benchmarks (#31, swarm-routing/.github#156): change tests and the anchor
run here, released versions in swarm-routing/benchmarks (its ADR-0002).
`.github/workflows/benchmark-cell.yml` is a thin caller of
swarm-routing/.github's `reusable-benchmark-cell.yml` in build mode: each cell
checks out its `source_sha`, builds `termite` with swarm-core at
`SWARM_CORE_REF` and routing-bench at a pinned ns3-tools commit on the ns3-dev
image given by digest, and runs `routing-compare`. Campaign plans live in
`tools/bench/campaigns/` and run through `ns3-campaign` (swarm-routing/ns3-tools
`python/ns3_tool/change_plan.py`; its docstring is the plan format).
`smoke.yaml` is the change-test smoke: Termite at a PR's head against its base,
two families (`grid-rwp`, `static-mesh`), 20 paired seeds. For a PR that
changes `core/` or `ns3/`, copy it with a new `generation` and the PR's base
and head commits in `pins`, then:

```bash
pip install pyyaml                                    # a YAML plan needs PyYAML
C="python3 ../ns3-tools/python/ns3_tool/campaign.py"   # or ns3-campaign (pip install ../ns3-tools/python)
$C plan P.yaml                                        # every job; dispatches nothing
$C dispatch P.yaml --cap 4                            # resumable: re-run until every label is logged
$C status P.yaml --brief                              # poll lightly (15 min)
G=$(python3 -c 'import sys,yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open(sys.argv[1]))["generation"])' P.yaml)
$C collect P.yaml --out ".campaign/$G/cells"          # rejects a cell whose ##PROV## is not its pin or the campaign's one dependency set
$C verdicts P.yaml --dir ".campaign/$G/cells"         # head minus base, paired 95 % CI per cell
```

and put the `verdicts` lines in the PR (no hand numbers, ns3-tools rule 13).
The dependency commits come from `benchmark-cell.yml` at the dispatch ref
(`main`), not from the plan, and `collect` (ns3-tools v0.2.0 or later,
swarm-routing/ns3-tools#148) also rejects a cell whose `##PROV## modules=`
dependency commits are not the one set the campaign's cells recorded first: do
not merge a change to that file's `dependencies` while a campaign is in
flight, or its later cells are rejected.
State lives in `.campaign/<generation>/` (git-ignored); a cell's artifact is
kept 7 days.

`core/` builds at C++23, the C++ standard of the ns-3 release the org
supports (ns-3's `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_MINIMUM`, C++23 from ns-3.46), the same
standard the ns-3 module compiles at inside ns-3 and the one swarm-core's
`core/` targets (swarm-routing/ns3-swarm-core#141, its `docs/api-policy.md`
"C++ standard"). `swarm::core` passes C++23 on as a compile feature from
swarm-routing/ns3-swarm-core#142 on; a pin before it builds swarm-core's own
sources at C++20 and passes on `cxx_std_20`, so `core/CMakeLists.txt` sets the
standard here itself either way.
When ns-3 raises its minimum, `core/CMakeLists.txt`'s `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`
follows.

## How this repository gets swarm-core and ns3-tools

- **swarm-core's `core/`**: `core/CMakeLists.txt` fetches it with CMake
  `FetchContent` at one commit, `SWARM_CORE_REF`. The `Makefile` and every
  workflow's swarm-core `core-deps` name the same commit; the
  `swarm-core / pin` check (swarm-routing/.github
  `tools/checks/check-swarm-core-pin.py`) fails when they disagree or when
  swarm-core `main` changed `core/` since the pin. org-bot's `swarm-core-pin`
  task then opens the bump PR (`org-bot/swarm-core-pin`), touching only those
  lines; review it and let it merge rather than bumping by hand.
- **The ns-3 build**: the `dependencies` input of
  `reusable-ns3-ci.yml` names the swarm-core and ns3-tools (`routing-bench`)
  refs the module builds on. A ref is a branch or a tag (`@vX.Y.Z`).
- **Working against an unreleased swarm-core**: `-DSWARM_CORE_DIR=<checkout>/core`
  builds `core/` on a local checkout instead of the pin (development only).
- **Next, from swarm-core v0.3.0** (swarm-routing/ns3-swarm-core#134): the
  commit pin becomes a release lock, `swarm-core.lock` (tag, commit and the
  release tarball's SHA256, every value read from the release), fetched by
  `URL` + `URL_HASH`; the ns-3 `dependencies` name release tags and
  `canary-dependencies` names `@main`, a non-blocking leg outside PRs
  (swarm-routing/.github#411). The `protocol-review` check warns about a new
  dependency on a moving ref. Later: `find_package(swarm-core CONFIG)` from
  an installed release, then a vcpkg registry (swarm-routing/ns3-swarm-core#135).

## Golden rules (invariants — do not break)

Org-wide (1–9), then this repo's own.

<!-- org-sync:begin org-rules -->
1. **Licensing per directory, as AntHocNet** ([`LICENSING.md`](LICENSING.md);
   AntHocNet [LICENSING.md](https://github.com/swarm-routing/AntHocNet/blob/main/LICENSING.md),
   [ADR-0028](https://github.com/swarm-routing/AntHocNet/blob/main/docs/adr/0028-core-is-dual-licensed.md)). A
   simulator-free `core/` and the standalone tooling are `MIT OR GPL-2.0-only`;
   ns-3 modules, the site, docs and data are `GPL-2.0-only`. Every original
   `.h`/`.hpp`/`.cc`/`.cpp`/`.py`/`.sh` starts with
   `// Copyright (c) 2026 Daniel Joppi (https://github.com/swarm-routing)` +
   `// SPDX-License-Identifier: <MIT OR GPL-2.0-only | GPL-2.0-only>` (`#`
   comments where needed), matching its directory in `LICENSING.md`; an
   outside contributor may add their own `Copyright (c) <year> <Name>` line
   beneath the org line, never replace it, and signs off every commit (DCO,
   CONTRIBUTING "Outside contributions"). CI (`reusable-licence-check.yml`)
   checks the SPDX line, and the org line's place when a header names more
   than one holder; a header with a single, other holder (a replaced org line,
   or third-party code) passes it, so review catches that. A new directory
   gets its row in `LICENSING.md` in the same PR.
2. **The licence boundary only goes one way.** GPL code may use the dual
   parts; dual code never pulls GPL-only code in: a `core/` file includes only
   the C++ standard library, other `core/` files and the dual-licensed `core/`
   of a dependency pinned by commit and declared as the `core-deps` input of
   every workflow that runs the licence check (one calling
   `reusable-licence-check.yml`, or one calling `reusable-ns3-ci.yml`, which
   forwards it; workflow file names differ per repo), each with the same pin,
   with `core-roots` naming the repo's own `core/`
   (without it the check skips core includes; a protocol's `core/` on
   swarm-core's; CI checks it, `check-headers.py --core-dep`), and a dual script imports no GPL-only code. Code coming from AntHocNet keeps its
   licence: its `core/`/`tools/` (dual) may land in dual or GPL paths here; its
   `ns3/` modules and `web/` (GPL-2.0-only) only in GPL paths. Third-party code
   (AntHocNet's vendored `aomdv`/`gpsr`, IITP RAS) lands only in GPL paths with
   its provenance recorded. Write clean implementations against public ns-3
   interfaces rather than copying ns-3's `src/aodv`/`src/olsr`.
3. **Wire formats are POD + versioned.** Control headers are
   simulator-independent POD structs with bounds-checked little-endian
   readers/writers, a leading version byte, and deterministic roundtrip + fuzz
   tests. Changing a field or its units bumps the version byte.
4. **No contrib module named `core`** (collides with ns-3's `src/core`). The
   shared module is `swarm-core` (`#include "ns3/swarm-core-module.h"`), and
   every protocol builds on it, AntHocNet included: `core/` on its `core/`, the
   ns-3 adapter on `SwarmRoutingBase` (swarm-routing/ns3-swarm-core#14).
5. **Determinism.** A fixed `--seed=<N>` gives byte-identical output. All
   randomness through the simulator's seeded streams or an injected RNG port;
   never libc `rand()`, wall-clock time, or unordered-container iteration order
   in anything that reaches an output.
6. **Comparisons are paired.** Per-seed deltas across >= 20 seeds, emitting the
   canonical `##CONFIG##`, `##RUN##`, `##BENCH##`, `##DIAG##` lines. A
   comparator arm (a protocol we did not design) counts only after its three
   gates: a fidelity sheet from its paper, the per-PR delivery smoke, and an
   anchor reproducing the paper's own trend.
7. **Keep bounded structures bounded** (visited paths, dedup histories, queues
   carry a configured cap).
8. **CI hygiene.** Actions pinned by full commit SHA with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment;
   buildx caches scoped per profile; transient artifacts `retention-days` <= 7.
   Every job that runs steps has a `timeout-minutes` cap (a job that only
   calls a reusable workflow cannot take one: the called workflow's jobs carry it), and every apt, npm or installer step
   its own, sized from recent green runs; `apt-get update` runs with
   `--error-on=any` inside a shell retry. Ubuntu mirror outages are the usual
   cause of a red run.
9. **Nothing shipped depends on `.claude/`.** Skills hold procedures; scripts
   that anything shipped needs live in `tools/` (AntHocNet ADR-0014).
<!-- org-sync:end org-rules -->
10. **`core/` never includes a simulator header**; the adapter only converts headers, executes `RouteDecision`s and owns timers/queues (AntHocNet golden rules 1–2).
11. **Paper fidelity is written down.** Every parameter default cites its dissertation or paper section or is marked a repo choice / unknown; deviations live in `docs/fidelity.md`.
12. **Explain the anchor miss before code.** AntHocNet's arm passed the delivery smoke but missed its anchor (v2.5.0: trend right, CIs span zero). Whether that was the arm, the scenario or power is pre-registered in an issue, with its evidence, before `core/` is written.
13. **Mind the licence split when promoting AntHocNet's `termite` arm** (GPL-2.0-only): its ns-3 code may land in `ns3/` as-is with provenance; the algorithm in `core/` (dual) is written fresh or carries a recorded dual-licence grant (AntHocNet ADR-0028's provenance gate). Paper copies stay in a private paper store the maintainer keeps, never in this public repository.

## Conventions

<!-- org-sync:begin conventions -->
- Issues follow the org taxonomy ([CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/swarm-routing/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#issues), from
  [AntHocNet ADR-0013](https://github.com/swarm-routing/AntHocNet/blob/main/docs/adr/0013-track-bugs-and-findings-as-issues.md)): one type label
  (`bug`/`enhancement`/`chore`/`documentation`/`verification`, plus `epic` for
  umbrellas), area label(s) (`protocol`/`adapter`/`ns3`/`benchmark`/
  `observability`/`packaging`/`learn-site`/`literature`), one `model:*`
  suggestion (a model on the Claude Pro plan), one `priority:P1|P2|P3` on
  non-epic issues (none on an epic), a
  `release:vX.Y.Z` label only when a release in the repository's ladder
  (`docs/roadmap.md`; until it lands, the org ROADMAP's release train)
  gates the issue: that label set is the version's scope,
  and the version is released when its issues are done (CONTRIBUTING
  "Cutting a release"). Labels come from `labels.json` via the `sync-labels`
  workflow, the shared `release:v0.1.0` to `release:v0.4.0` and
  `release:v1.0.0` among them; a version outside that set is added to
  `swarm-routing/.github`'s `labels.json` (and CONTRIBUTING's label table)
  when a ladder needs it, and reaches a repository when its `sync-labels` runs
  (monthly, or dispatched after the change merges),
  or, in a repository that keeps its own release labels (AntHocNet), created
  there with `gh label create release:vX.Y.Z` when its ladder adds the version.
- Issue bodies: **Context** (evidence, numbers, links) · **Scope** ·
  **Acceptance criteria** (checkboxes) · **Depends on** (cross-repo form
  `swarm-routing/<repo>#N`) · **References**. Children of an epic say "Part of
  #N" and are linked as sub-issues. Comments you post end with the Claude Code
  footer.
- Issues migrated from AntHocNet carry `migrated` and start with *Migrated from
  `danieljoppi/AntHocNet#N`*.
- Epics are listed where contributors look. In a public repository, this
  README's `## Epics` section and the org
  [ROADMAP](https://github.com/swarm-routing/.github/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#epics)
  are generated from the issues labelled `epic` by `swarm-routing/.github`'s
  `tools/epics/epics.py`. An open epic is Planned (no sub-issue closed) or In
  progress (some closed); it becomes Done or Dropped only when you close the
  epic itself (as completed or as not planned), even if every sub-issue is
  closed. Whenever you change an epic (open, close, rename or re-scope it, add
  or remove its `epic` label) or one of its sub-issues (close, reopen, add,
  unlink), refresh the lists in that PR or the next one. You need
  `swarm-routing/.github` checked out next to this repository and `gh` logged
  in (or `GH_TOKEN` set). Run `python3 ../.github/tools/epics/epics.py readme .`
  in the repository that owns the epic (for a sub-issue of another
  repository's epic, that repository, not this one), then
  `python3 tools/epics/epics.py roadmap ROADMAP.md` and
  `python3 tools/epics/epics.py profile profile/README.md` in `.github`. Never
  edit a generated section by hand; the weekly `epics` workflow in `.github`
  only reports drift. Private repositories are never listed
  and keep no generated section.
- Make minimal, reviewable changes; update the relevant doc/ADR when you change
  a documented decision.
<!-- org-sync:end conventions -->

## Git workflow

<!-- org-sync:begin git-workflow -->
- Branch from `main` (`claude/<short-topic>`), one focused change per PR.
- **Always open a PR to `main`** once the branch is pushed — every change is
  tracked through one.
- **PRs are squash-merged** (the only merge method enabled). The PR title is
  the commit on `main`, so it is a lowercase Conventional Commit
  (`feat:`/`fix:`/`docs:`/`chore:`/`ci:`…, optional scope).
- Push with `git push -u origin <branch>`; merge when CI is green.
- **`main` takes no direct push**, in any repo: its ruleset requires a PR and
  the required checks, not an up-to-date branch. Bots push `bot/<name>` branches
  and open PRs; a release is the bump PR from `bot/release`, tagged after it
  merges (CONTRIBUTING "Cutting a release").
- A PR behind `main` may merge as it is: the ruleset does not require an
  up-to-date branch. Update it first
  (`gh api -X PUT "repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>/update-branch"`, with
  `<owner>/<repo>` the PR's base repository and `<n>` its number) only when
  `main` changed what it touches (a template, a workflow, a required check),
  then merge after its CI on the updated branch. A
  repository with a merge queue (`merge_queue = true` in its `[settings]`)
  is not updated by hand: enable auto-merge and the queue tests each PR on
  the latest `main` and merges it (CONTRIBUTING "Merge when CI is green").
  Never force-push a branch someone else pushed. A behind `bot/release` PR is the exception:
  dispatch the release `bump` again, so the version and changelog are rebuilt
  on the new `main`.
- **Settings are code.** Repository settings, rulesets, required checks and the
  Actions allowlist change only by a PR to the repo's `[settings]` in
  `.github/org-sync.toml` or to `templates/rulesets/` in `swarm-routing/.github`,
  never in the UI or by a direct API write. A `templates/rulesets/` change
  applies on merge; a repo's `[settings]` change applies when `repo-settings`
  in `swarm-routing/.github` is dispatched with mode `apply` after the merge
  (the daily run only checks). A required check runs on every PR (no `paths:`
  filter; skip work inside a gate job instead) and is named exactly as its
  check run. A new third-party action goes into `defaults.json`
  `selected_actions` (`templates/rulesets/`) before or with the workflow that
  uses it: in the same PR in `swarm-routing/.github`, otherwise merged there
  first, or `repo-settings` refuses the repo.

## Agent skills

The org's procedures ship as the Claude Code plugin **`swarm-routing`**, from
[`swarm-routing/skills`](https://github.com/swarm-routing/skills). This
repository's `.claude/settings.json` enables it, so Claude Code offers a skill
when the task matches its description. Other agents (Codex, Cursor, Copilot, …)
install the same skills with `npx skills add swarm-routing/skills`
([skills.sh](https://skills.sh)). A skill is the procedure; the script does the
work and runs without it (golden rule 9), so an agent without the skill starts
from the script; so does a session that does not read this repository's
settings (some hosted sessions with several repositories do not). If Claude
Code says the plugin is missing (it was called
`org-repo` before 2026-11-09, and a cached marketplace keeps the old list), run
`claude plugin marketplace update swarm-routing` and start a new session.

| Task | Script (any agent) | Skill |

| Give a repository its docs/references.bib, or review it: every paper and org release it relies on, confirmed from Crossref, DataCite or Zenodo (a work with no DOI, such as a thesis, from its publisher's or institution's record, with its url), DOI links first, the fidelity Sources table and CITATION.cff references generated from it | `swarm-routing/.github` `tools/fidelity/fidelity.py` (bib), `tools/zenodo/zenodo.py` | `references` |
| Take open pull requests from review to merge: CI, mergeable state and unresolved review threads in one view, each finding verified and fixed or answered, then merged when green (auto-merge where the repository has a merge queue) | `swarm-routing/.github` `tools/pr-status/pr_status.py` | `pr-shepherd` |
| Measure what a Claude Code session loads from the agent files (`CLAUDE.md` and its `@` imports, or `AGENTS.md` alone), or where a finished Claude Code session's tokens went, before cutting or adding agent text | `swarm-routing/skills` `tools/token-audit/token_audit.py` | `token-audit` |
| Register a repository for the OpenSSF Best Practices badge, propose its answers and check they stay current | `swarm-routing/.github` `tools/bestpractices/bestpractices.py` | `bestpractices` |

A skill only this repository uses lives in its own `.claude/skills/`; a skill
two repositories need moves to the plugin. Skills that file, cite and extract
papers stay in a private library the maintainer keeps; finding
new papers and confirming a reference is public (`lit-search`). A public skill
may point to that library's skills, never carry its content. This section is managed by org-sync: add
a row in `swarm-routing/.github` `templates/agents/skills.md`, not here (an edit
here is undone by the next `org_sync.py apply`).

## Working defaults

Condensed from [andrej-karpathy-skills](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills).

- **Assumptions:** state the ones that matter. Ask only when the choice
  belongs to the maintainer: a default, a published number, a cell, the scope.
  Then give your recommendation and its reason with the question, never the
  options alone. Otherwise pick the sensible option, say which, and keep
  going. Long unattended runs, like campaigns, depend on that.
- **Simplicity:** the least code that solves the task. No speculative
  features, configurability or abstractions for one use.
- **Surgical diffs:** every changed line traces to the request. Match the
  surrounding style. Mention unrelated dead code rather than deleting it, and
  remove only the orphans your own change created.
- **Verifiable goals:** a bug gets a reproducing test first; a refactor passes
  before and after. Finish when the check passes, not when the code looks right.

## Session habits

- **Handoffs are always a ticket.** When a session ends with work in flight, or a
  handoff is asked for, open a GitHub issue from the *Handoff* template (label
  `handoff`); a session that continued a handoff updates that issue instead of
  opening another. Never write a handoff file in the repo. A session that
  continues handed-off work starts from the newest open `handoff` issue for
  that work; a new task starts from the request. Close the issue, and any
  older one it superseded, when the work it hands off is done ([AntHocNet ADR-0013](https://github.com/swarm-routing/AntHocNet/blob/main/docs/adr/0013-track-bugs-and-findings-as-issues.md) item 5).
- **Attach only the repositories the task needs.** Each attached repository's
  agent files are loaded into every request, whether the task touches it or
  not.
- **Start from the record, not from memory:** the matching `handoff` issue,
  then the issue's acceptance criteria, then `main`. Check a claim against its
  source before it goes into an issue or a PR.
- **Script what repeats.** A check or a lookup run more than a few times
  becomes a script in `tools/` that prints a summary; the model reads the
  verdict, not the raw data (AntHocNet ADR-0014).
- **Measure before cutting or adding agent text:** the `token-audit` skill
  (`swarm-routing/skills` `tools/token-audit/token_audit.py`) prints what a
  session loads and where a finished session's tokens went.

## Response style — caveman (token economy)

Answer in tight, low-filler prose: drop hedging, pleasantries, and preamble; keep
the substance. Fewer output tokens on every reply, same information.

**Carve-out (the record stays full).** Keep byte-for-byte exact — code,
commands, file paths, error text, benchmark numbers. And keep the *durable
record* detailed, never terse: commit messages, PR bodies, ADRs, `docs/`, and
issue / finding threads. Cross-session traceability depends on those being
complete — AntHocNet's AC_BE_NQOS / A2 investigation was only recoverable
because the issue threads were thorough. Caveman the chat, not the record.

## Agent pitfalls

- `gh api … -F body=@file` reads the file; `-f body=@file` posts the literal
  text `@file`.
- When the permission system refuses a command (a merge, say), stop and report
  it. Never retry it another way, and never ask another agent to run it.
- A PR body's `Closes #N` closes the issue on merge; write `Part of #N` while
  acceptance criteria remain open.
- Before saying a tool or check is missing, look at `main` (`git fetch`,
  `origin/main`), not a stale local checkout.
- In an issue, PR or comment, write every issue of another repository in
  full, `swarm-routing/<repo>#N`, also inside a list or a range. A bare `#N`
  links to the repository the text is in: in
  `swarm-routing/AntHocNet#65, #151` the second number points at this
  repository's #151 (swarm-routing/.github#277).
- A sentence in `ROADMAP.md` or an AGENTS.md that calls an issue done is not
  evidence: read the issue's acceptance criteria. On 2026-11-12 nine issues
  described as done had open criteria (swarm-routing/.github#274).
- Change text inside `org-sync:begin/end` markers only through the template
  in `swarm-routing/.github` `templates/`: one PR there, then org-bot's
  `bot/org-sync` refresh PR in each repository. A hand edit per repository
  stays red on `check / org-sync` (swarm-routing/.github#236).
- In a repository with a merge queue, merge by enabling auto-merge (squash);
  a direct merge (`PUT pulls/<n>/merge`) is refused with HTTP 405. Only the
  required checks (`gh api 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/main'`, which
  `gh` fills from the checkout) gate a merge: a red or pending report-only
  check (`codecov/patch`, Sonar) is triaged, not waited on. A red `dco` on an
  outside contributor's commit still holds the PR until that author signs
  off; on the maintainer's or an agent's commits it is expected
  (swarm-routing/.github#212). `dco` is not a required check and runs on
  `pull_request` only, so merge an outside contributor's PR, by auto-merge or
  directly, only after `dco` passed on the head commit that merges. Never push
  to an outside contributor's PR: ask them for the change, or make it in a
  follow-up PR after the merge (swarm-routing/.github#288). If the maintainer
  must push to such a PR, first disable auto-merge, or, if the PR is already
  in a merge queue, remove it from the queue (disabling auto-merge does not).
  Re-enable auto-merge, or enqueue it again, only after `dco` passed on the
  new head: GitHub keeps auto-merge on after a push by someone with write
  access, and `dco` is not a required check.
- `review / coderabbit` is a required check (the review gate,
  swarm-routing/.github#294): it passes once CodeRabbit has reviewed the PR,
  once it says it will not, for a draft, or 30 minutes after the PR opened
  (then with one comment). So auto-merge may be enabled at once: the merge
  waits for the gate, and the ruleset holds it while a CodeRabbit thread is
  unresolved. Still read every thread and fix or answer it before resolving.
  Where the gate is not required yet (`gh api
  'repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/main'` does not list it), wait first
  with `python3 -I ../.github/tools/pr-status/pr_status.py gate REPO#N`,
  which waits for CodeRabbit alone (swarm-routing/.github#238).
- Never add a `Signed-off-by` trailer, for the maintainer or anyone else: a
  DCO sign-off is a person's own certification (CONTRIBUTING "Outside
  contributions").
- Releases are cut on request only: dispatch the release `bump` when the
  maintainer asks, once the version's `release:vX.Y.Z` issues are done and
  its exit criteria in the ladder (`docs/roadmap.md`, or the org ROADMAP's
  release train until it lands) are met; never approve a gated publish. A
  failed publish is recovered with "Re-run all jobs", never "Re-run failed
  jobs" (CONTRIBUTING "Cutting a release"). Never type a release's DOI: read
  it from Zenodo. After a public repository's release publishes, confirm the
  site saw it: a `[release-sync] <repo> <tag>` issue opens in
  `swarm-routing/swarm-routing.github.io` and a `release-sync.yml` run for
  that release ends green. If, an hour after the release, no issue has
  opened or no run for it has ended green, dispatch the site's
  `release-sync.yml` with `repository` (`owner/repo`) and `tag` and check
  that run (CONTRIBUTING "Cutting a release"); its weekly Monday run is only
  the backstop.
- Cite a paper in a public issue, PR or doc by its `https://doi.org/<DOI>`
  link, read from its record (`lit-search` confirms it), or, for a work with
  no DOI, by its publisher's or institution's page; never point into or name
  the private paper library there.
